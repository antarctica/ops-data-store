# Operations Data Store

Data store for hosted and managed datasets for BAS Field Operations and Air Unit.

## Overview

### Purpose

This Data Store is a platform provided by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Mapping and Geospatial Information Centre
([MAGIC](https://bas.ac.uk/teams/magic)) for hosting vector geospatial data used by BAS Operational Teams.

It consists of a limited set of managed datasets used and controlled by the BAS Air Unit and Field Operations teams for
planning and delivering field seasons.

**Note:** This project is focused on needs within the British Antarctic Survey. It has been open-sourced in case it's
of use to others with similar or related needs. Some resources, indicated with a ðŸ›¡ symbol, are not accessible publicly.

### Status

This project is an early alpha. The aim is to provide a robust, useful, live service within the next few field seasons.

The aim for this season is to provide a initial minimal implementation which meets core user needs. This will likely
change in form and function based on feedback from end-users and our experience of operating the platform.

### Limitations

As an alpha project, all, or parts, of this service:

- may, but should not, stop working (due to regressions or instability)
- may not work correctly, or as expectedly (including destructively)
- may change at any time (in terms of implementation or functionality)
- may have missing or outdated documentation

**Note:** Support for this project is provided on a best efforts / 'as is' basis.

**WARNING:** Outputs from this project should not be relied upon for operational use without through scrutiny.

### Related projects

This project is limited to the technical and operational aspects of providing a platform for hosting datasets. Other
projects focus on these datasets and other aspects of a providing a wider Geographic Information System (GIS).

* [BAS Field Operations Data ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/operations/field-operations-gis-data)
* [BAS Air Unit Network Data ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/air-unit-network-dataset)

This project is an evolution of an earlier [Experiment ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/felnne/ops-data-store-exp).

## Usage

### End-user documentation

End-users should consult the documentation developed for the wider
[Field Operations GIS Platform ðŸ›¡](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MbhSFJ1AEZxhIfX9tgr/s/HmSXoUpviCA3XCta5MDr/), as this
specific project is not aimed at end-users directly.

### Control CLI

A command line interface is available for performing administrative tasks. Calling this CLI typically requires
connecting to a specific instance/environment and activating the relevant Python virtual environment

```
$ ssh [instance]
$ source [venv/bin/activate]
$ ods-ctl --help
```

Currently, all log entries, at debug level, are displayed alongside programme output.

#### Control CLI `config` commands

- `ods-ctl config show`: displays the current application configuration

#### Control CLI `db` commands

- `ods-ctl db check`: verifies the database is available
- `ods-ctl db setup`: configure a new database for use
- `ods-ctl db run --input-path [path/to/file.sql]`: runs SQL commands contained in the input file

### QGIS project

The included QGIS project, developed as part of the wider Field Operations and Air Unit GIS, can be used for testing
editing workflows and verifying expected behaviour.

1. start QGIS LTR with the *ops-data-store* profile selected:
    - macOS: `open -a QGIS-LTR.app --args --profile ops-data-store`
    - windows: `C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.28.7\bin\qgis-bin.exe --profile ops-data-store`
1. open the included QGIS project file [`qgis-project.qgz`](/qgis/qgis-project.qgz)

## Implementation

### Command line interface

[Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com) is used as the framework for the control CLI.

### Configuration

The [control CLI](#command-line-interface) uses a [`Config`](src/ops_data_store/config.py) class for all settings. Some
settings are read-only, such as the application version, others are write-only, such as database connection details,
and must be defined by the user using an appropriate environment variable, or `.env` file.

| Config Property | Environment Variable | Required | Type   | Description                                     | Example                          |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `VERSION`       | -                    | No       | String | Application version, read from package metadata | '0.1.0'                          |
| `DB_DSN`        | `APP_ODS_DB_DSN`     | Yes      | String | Application database connection string          | 'postgresql://user:pass@host/db' |

The `DB_DSN` config option must be a valid [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org) connection string. Only Postgres databases
are officially supported in this project.

### Database

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is used for storing datasets. It uses the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net) extension for storing spatial information
along with custom functions and data types for:

- creating [ULIDs](https://github.com/ulid/spec) (stored as a UUID data-type)
  - [pgcrypto](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgcrypto.html) extension, `generate_ulid` function
- formatting latitude and longitude values in the Degrees, Decimal Minutes format (DDM)
  - using the `geom_as_ddm` function and `ddm_point` data type

### QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org) is the QGIS client end-users will use for editing and visualising geospatial data, and acts as
the database client in relation to this project specifically.

For consistency/compatibility, the QGIS profile and project developed for the wider GIS are used for consistency and
compatibility.

## Datasets

Datasets hosted in this platform can be classed as either:

- managed: formally agreed and defined datasets that are explicitly checked and verified by this platform
- unmanaged: any other datasets users may wish to store, which are essentially ignored by this platform

### Managed datasets

Managed datasets are not defined within this project (as it only provides the platform), see these projects instead:

- BAS [Field Operations GIS Data ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/operations/field-operations-gis-data)
- BAS [Air Unit Network Dataset ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/air-unit-network-dataset)

### Managed dataset identifiers

All managed datasets will have two or more identifiers, of which three are conventional and recommended:

| Domain     | Owner    | Audience  | Attribute Name | Data Type | Format/Scheme                         | Required |
|------------|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| Technology | MAGIC/IT | MAGIC/IT  | `pk`           | Integer   | PostgreSQL Identity                   | Yes      |
| Platform   | MAGIC    | MAGIC/Ops | `pid`          | UUID      | [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec)  | Yes      |
| Dataset    | Ops      | MAGIC/Ops | `id`           | String    | -                                     | No       |

For example, a dataset of waypoints may be structured as:

| PK  | PID                           | ID      | ... |
|-----|-------------------------------|---------|-----|
| `1` | `01H26N7D9Q064B6QQMCPP5NQK0 ` | `ALPHA` | ... |
| ... | ...                           | ...     | ... |
| `9` | `01H26N7D9SGG348R24KN6W50GX ` | `INDIA` | ... |
| ... | ...                           | ...     | ... |

#### Technology identifier

This ID is dictated by whichever technology used to implement this platform. For Postgres, this is a primary key using
an [Integer identity](https://www.depesz.com/2017/04/10/waiting-for-postgresql-10-identity-columns/) column, as they
are the easiest to manage.

**WARNING!** This column MUST NOT be relied upon outside each individual database instance, as it MAY NOT be the same
between instances. If we use a different technology in the future, this MAY use a different concept, necessitating the
loss of any existing values.

**Note:** This attribute SHOULD NOT be exposed to end-users, either by using database views, or configuring fields in
layers, to hide the column.

#### Platform identifier

This ID is dictated by us to uniquely and persistently identify features across all datasets hosted in the platform
and ideally across datasets anywhere (i.e. globally unique). The [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) scheme is used to
implement these identifiers as they're reasonably compact and naturally sort by time.

Once issued they do not change and SHOULD be used to distinguish features and/or for defining feature relations.
Crucially this value has no meaning (to us or end-users) and is therefore neutral. This identifier MAY be exposed to
end-users, though it is assumed they won't use or recognise them directly.

**Note:** `PID` was chosen to avoid using `FID`, as this is typically used, and possibly reserved, in GIS systems.

**Note:** ULIDs are stored in a Postgres UUID data type to improve indexing. This results in a non-standard
representation which can appear misleading.

#### Dataset identifier

This ID is not required, though it's assumed almost all datasets will have a value that users use to identify features,
even if only for a time limited period. Values are uncontrolled in terms of needing to be:

- unique
- applied consistently
- following a scheme or convention
- meaningful and/or recognisable by end-users
- persistent over time

**Note:** These properties are nevertheless recommended in any identifier.

## Setup

### Requirements

Required infrastructure:

* a service or server for running [Python](https://www.python.org) applications
* a service or server for running [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) databases

Required OS packages for Python app server:

* Python 3.9+
* GDAL 3.4
* libxml (including the `xmllint` binary)
* libpq

**Note:** The GDAL OS and Python packages *MUST* be the same version, and must therefore be version `3.4`.

Required Postgres extensions:

* PostGIS
* pgcrypto
- fuzzystrmatch

A single database, and an account with permissions to create, read, update and delete objects within this, is required
to run this application. This database and account can be named anything but `ops_data_store` and `ops_data_store_app`
are recommended as conventional defaults.

### Installation

For the Python application, it is strongly recommended to install this project into a virtual environment:

```shell
$ python -m venv /path/to/venv
$ source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

The Python Package for this project (see [Deployment](#deployment) section) requires installing from a private package
registry provided by the BAS GitLab instance. This registry requires authentication, however as this project is
available publicly, and has been open sourced, the generic deployment token below can be used by anyone to access it.

```shell
pip install ops-data-store --extra-index-url https://public-access:RPiBoxfdzokx_GSzST5M@gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/api/v4/projects/1134/packages/pypi/simple
```

The control CLI can be used to check the application has been installed correctly and is the expected version:

```shell
# if installed in a virtual environment
$ source /path/to/venv/bin/activate

$ ods-ctl --version
0.1.0

```

Optionally, create a `.env` file to set [Configuration](#configuration) options or use relevant environment variables.

**Note:** If using an `.env` file, the application will look in parent directory of where the application is installed
(i.e. the virtual environment) and it's parents, up to the root directory (i.e. `/`). Common directories for
configuration files such as `/etc/` and `~/.config/` are not checked.

To check the application configuration is as expected:

```
$ ods-ctl config show
```

To check the application database is available, and then configure it for use:

```
$ ods-ctl db check
Ok. DB connection successful.

$ ods-ctl db setup
Setting up database for first time use.
Note: If this command fails, please either create an issue in the 'Ops Data Store' project in GitLab, or contact MAGIC at magic@bas.ac.uk with the output of this command.
Ok. Database setup complete.
```

## Project Setup [WIP]

**Note:** This section is a work in progress and may be restructured.

### GitLab

- create project with package registry and CI/CD enabled
- create deployment token for allowing anyone to install packages:
  - name: "Public Access"
  - username: "public-access"
  - scopes: *read_package_registry*

### BAS IT

- contact IT to request an application server for running Python applications
- contact IT to request a Postgres database with required extensions

## Development

### Local development environment

Check out project:

```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store.git
$ cd ops-data-store
```

**Note:** If you do not have access to the BAS GitLab instance, clone from GitHub as a read-only copy instead.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is used for managing the Python environment and dependencies.

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is strongly recommended to ensure the Python version is the same as the one
used in externally provisioned environments. This is currently *3.9.18*.

```shell
$ pyenv install 3.9.18
$ pyenv local 3.9.18
$ poetry install
```

Two [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) databases on a host running or accessible locally with the required
extensions available are required (one for local development and one for testing).

For example, if a Postgres instance is running locally with trust based authentication for the local user:

```shell
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ops_data_store_dev;"
psql -d postgres -c "COMMENT ON DATABASE ops_data_store_dev IS 'Ops Data Store local development DB'";
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ops_data_store_test;"
psql -d postgres -c "COMMENT ON DATABASE ops_data_store_test IS 'Ops Data Store local development testing DB'"
```

It's strongly recommended to set required configuration options using a `.env` file based off the
[`.example.env`](/.example.env) file as a reference.

A `.test.env` file MUST be created as per the [Testing Configuration](#test-config) section.

Setup the database and load the [Test Schemas and Data](#test-schemas-and-data):

```
$ poetry run ops-ctl db setup
$ poetry run ops-ctl db run --input-path tests/resources/test-schemas.sql
$ poetry run ops-ctl db run --input-path tests/resources/test-data.sql
```

The QGIS profile used for testing needs [downloading ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/packages/)
from GitLab package registry (as it's too large to sensibly store in Git).

Once downloaded, extract and rename to `ops-data-store`. Then copy to the relevant QGIS profile directory:

* macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles/`

### Running control CLI locally

```shell
$ poetry run ods-ctl [COMMAND] [ARGS]
```

### Contributing

All code changes should be:

- made using a merge request associated with an issue in the project's
  [Issue Tracker ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/issues)
- summarised in the [Change log](./CHANGELOG.md)

### Editorconfig

For consistency is strongly recommended to configure your IDE or other editor to use the [EditorConfig](https://EditorConfig.org) settings defined in [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig).

### Conventions

- except for tests, all Python code should be contained in the [`ops_data_store`](/src/ops_data_store/) package.
- use `Path.resolve()` if displaying or logging file/directory paths in Python
- Python dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) in `pyproject.toml`
- configuration options should be defined in the common [`Config`](/src/ops_data_store/config.py) class and this README
- configuration options should be read using the relevant [environs](https://github.com/sloria/environs) helper method
- use logging to record how actions progress, using the `app` logger (e.g. `logger = logging.getLogger('app')`)

### Python dependency vulnerability checks

The [Safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) package is used to check dependencies against known vulnerabilities.

**WARNING!** As with all security tools, Safety is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.
In particular this is using the free vulnerability database, which is updated less frequently than paid options.

Checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration). To check locally:

```shell
$ poetry run safety check --full-report
```

### Python static security analysis

Ruff is configured to run [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit), a static analysis tool for Python.

**WARNING!** As with all security tools, Bandit is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.
In particular this tool can't check for issues that are only be detectable when running code.

### Python linting

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is used to lint Python files. Specific checks and config options are set in
`pyproject.toml`. Linting checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration). To check
locally:

```shell
$ poetry run ruff src/
```

## Testing

### Python tests

All 1st party Python code in the [`ops_data_store`](/src/ops_data_store/) package must be covered by tests, defined in
the [`ops_data_store_tests`](/tests/ops_data_store_tests/) package.

[`pytest`](https://pytest.org) is used as the test framework, configured in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

#### Python test fixtures

Fixtures should be defined in [`conftest.py`](tests/conftest.py), prefixed with `fx_` to indicate they are a fixture,
e.g.:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def fx_test_foo() -> str:
    """Example of a test fixture."""
    return 'foo'
```

#### Python test coverage

Test coverage is checked with [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) with an aim for 100% coverage
(with some exceptions). Exemptions for coverage should be used sparingly and only with good justification. Where tests
are added to ensure coverage, the `cov` [mark](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/mark.html) should be added, e.g:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.cov
def test_foo():
    assert 'foo' == 'foo'
```

#### Test config

An additional [`.test.env`](/.test.env) file is used to override some application config properties, such as the
database. This file requires creating from the [`.example.env`](/.example.env) reference file.

### Test schemas and data

A set of static datasets are defined for testing. These datasets are based on real [Datasets](#datasets) but sanitised
to remove any sensitive information. To support repeatable testing these datasets do not change.

See [`test-schemas.sql`](tests/resources/test-schemas.sql) for the structure of each dataset and
[`test-data.sql`](tests/resources/test-data.sql) for related seed data (4 features for each).

**Note:** This data is not yet representative. For details see
[https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/issues/48 ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/issues/48).

#### Running tests

Tests and coverage checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration). To check
locally:

```shell
poetry run dotenv -f .test.env run -- pytest --strict-markers --random-order --cov --cov-report=html tests
```

### Continuous Integration

All commits will trigger Continuous Integration using GitLab's CI/CD platform, configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

The Docker Image used for CI is needed to ensure the correct version of the GDAL is used, which is then configured to
use the correct Python version.

## Deployment

### Python package

This project is distributed as a Python package installable from a private package registry provided by the BAS
GitLab instance. It is built by Poetry automatically as part of [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment). If
needed it can also be built manually:

```
$ poetry build
```

### QGIS profile

If the QGIS profile used for testing needs updating, the generic package stored in GitLab can be updated:

```shell
$ curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $BAS_GITLAB_TOKEN" --upload-file qgis/qgis-profile.zip https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/api/v4/projects/1134/packages/generic/qgis-profile/[version]/qgis-profile.zip
```

Where `[version]` is replaced with a calendar based version `YYYY-MM-DD.N`, e.g. the first release on April 12th 2024
would become `2023-04-12.0`. A second release that day would be `2023-04-12.1` etc.

For example:

```shell
$ curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $BAS_GITLAB_TOKEN" --upload-file qgis/qgis-profile.zip https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/api/v4/projects/1134/packages/generic/qgis-profile/2023-04-12.0/qgis-profile.zip
```

### Continuous Deployment

Tagged commits will trigger Continuous Deployment using GitLab's CI/CD platform, configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## Releases

- [all releases ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/releases)
- [latest release ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/releases/permalink/latest)

To create a release, create an issue using the *release* issue template and follow it's steps.
