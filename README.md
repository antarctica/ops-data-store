# Operations Data Store

Data store for hosted and managed datasets for BAS Field Operations and Air Unit.

## Overview

### Purpose

This Data Store is a platform provided by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Mapping and Geospatial Information Centre
([MAGIC](https://bas.ac.uk/teams/magic)) for hosting vector geospatial data used by BAS Operational Teams.

It consists of a limited set of managed datasets used and controlled by the BAS Air Unit and Field Operations teams for
planning and delivering field seasons.

**Note:** This project is focused on needs within the British Antarctic Survey. It has been open-sourced in case it's
of use to others with similar or related needs. Some resources, indicated with a ðŸ›¡ symbol, are not accessible publicly.

### Status

This project is an early alpha. The aim is to provide a robust, useful, live service within the next few field seasons.

The aim for this season is to provide a initial minimal implementation which meets core user needs. This will likely
change in form and function based on feedback from end-users and our experience of operating the platform.

### Limitations

As an alpha project, all, or parts, of this service:

- may, but should not, stop working (due to regressions or instability)
- may not work correctly, or as expectedly (including destructively)
- may change at any time (in terms of implementation or functionality)
- may have missing or outdated documentation

**Note:** Support for this project is provided on a best efforts / 'as is' basis.

**WARNING:** Outputs from this project should not be relied upon for operational use without through scrutiny.

### Related projects

This project is limited to the technical and operational aspects of providing a platform for hosting datasets. Other
projects focus on these datasets and other aspects of a providing a wider Geographic Information System (GIS).

* [BAS Field Operations Data ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/operations/field-operations-gis-data)
* [BAS Air Unit Network Data ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/air-unit-network-dataset)

This project is an evolution of an earlier [Experiment ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/felnne/ops-data-store-exp).

## Usage

### End-user documentation

End-users should consult the documentation developed for the wider
[Field Operations GIS Platform ðŸ›¡](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MbhSFJ1AEZxhIfX9tgr/s/HmSXoUpviCA3XCta5MDr/), as this
specific project is not aimed at end-users directly.

### Control CLI

A command line interface is available for performing administrative tasks. Calling this CLI typically requires
connecting to a specific instance/environment and activating the relevant Python virtual environment

```
$ ssh [instance]
$ source [venv/bin/activate]
$ ods-ctl --help
```

Currently, all log entries, at debug level, are displayed alongside programme output.

#### Control CLI `config` commands

- `ods-ctl config show`: displays the current application configuration

#### Control CLI `db` commands

- `ods-ctl db check`: verifies the database is available
- `ods-ctl db run --input-path [path/to/file.sql]`: runs SQL commands contained in the input file

### QGIS project

The included QGIS project, developed as part of the wider Field Operations and Air Unit GIS, can be used for testing
editing workflows and verifying expected behaviour.


1. start QGIS LTR with the *ops-data-store* profile selected:
    - macOS: `open -a QGIS-LTR.app --args --profile ops-data-store`
    - windows: `C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.28.7\bin\qgis-bin.exe --profile ops-data-store`
1. open the included QGIS project file [`qgis-project.qgz`](/qgis/qgis-project.qgz)

## Implementation

### Command line interface

The control CLI uses [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com) as a framework.

### Configuration

The [control CLI](#command-line-interface) uses a [`Config`](src/ops_data_store/config.py) class for all settings. Some
settings are read-only, such as the application version, others are write-only, such as database connection details,
and must be defined by the user using an appropriate environment variable, or `.env` file.

| Config Property | Environment Variable | Required | Type   | Description                                     | Example                          |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `VERSION`       | -                    | No       | String | Application version, read from package metadata | '0.1.0'                          |
| `DB_DSN`        | `APP_ODS_DB_DSN`     | Yes      | String | Application database connection string          | 'postgresql://user:pass@host/db' |

The `DB_DSN` config option must be a valid [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org) connection string. Only Postgres databases
are officially supported in this project.

### QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org) is the tool used by end-users for editing and visualising geospatial data. For this project
specifically, QGIS forms the Postgres database client used.

To ensure consistency/compatibility with the QGIS environment end-users will use, The QGIS profile and project
developed outside this project are used for consistency and compatibility.

## Setup

### Requirements

Required infrastructure:

* a service or server for running [Python](https://www.python.org) applications
* a service or server for running [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) databases

Required OS packages for Python app server:

* Python 3.9+
* GDAL 3.4
* libxml (including the `xmllint` binary)
* libpq

**Note:** The GDAL OS and Python packages *MUST* be the same version, and must therefore be version `3.4`.

Required Postgres extensions:

* PostGIS
* pgcrypto

A single database, and an account with permissions to create, read, update and delete objects within this, is required
to run this application. This database and account can be named anything but `ops_data_store` and `ops_data_store_app`
are recommended as conventional defaults.

### Installation

For the Python application, it is strongly recommended to install this project into a virtual environment:

```shell
$ python -m venv /path/to/venv
$ source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

The Python Package for this project (see [Deployment](#deployment) section) requires installing from a private package
registry provided by the BAS GitLab instance. This registry requires authentication, however as this project is
available publicly, and has been open sourced, the generic deployment token below can be used by anyone to access it.

```shell
pip install ops-data-store --extra-index-url https://public-access:RPiBoxfdzokx_GSzST5M@gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/api/v4/projects/1134/packages/pypi/simple
```

The control CLI can be used to check the application has been installed correctly and is the expected version:

```shell
# if installed in a virtual environment
$ source /path/to/venv/bin/activate

$ ods-ctl --version
0.1.0

$ ods-ctl db check
Ok. DB connection successful.
```

## Project Setup [WIP]

**Note:** This section is a work in progress and may be restructured.

### GitLab

- create project with package registry and CI/CD enabled
- create deployment token for allowing anyone to install packages:
  - name: "Public Access"
  - username: "public-access"
  - scopes: *read_package_registry*

### BAS IT

- contact IT to request an application server for running Python applications
- contact IT to request a Postgres database with required extensions

## Development

### Local development environment

Check out project:

```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store.git
$ cd ops-data-store
```

**Note:** If you do not have access to the BAS GitLab instance, clone from GitHub as a read-only copy instead.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is used for managing the Python environment and dependencies.

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is strongly recommended to ensure the Python version is the same as the one
used in externally provisioned environments. This is currently *3.9.18*.

```shell
$ pyenv install 3.9.18
$ pyenv local 3.9.18
$ poetry install
```

Two [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) databases on a host running or accessible locally with the required
extensions available are required (one for local development and one for testing).

For example, if a Postgres instance is running locally with trust based authentication for the local user:

```shell
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ops_data_store_dev;"
psql -d postgres -c "COMMENT ON DATABASE ops_data_store_dev IS 'Ops Data Store local development DB'";
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ops_data_store_test;"
psql -d postgres -c "COMMENT ON DATABASE ops_data_store_test IS 'Ops Data Store local development testing DB'"
```

It's strongly recommended to set required configuration options using a `.env` file based off the
[`.example.env`](/.example.env) file as a reference.

A `.test.env` file MUST be created as per the [Testing Configuration](#test-config) section.

The QGIS profile used for testing needs [downloading ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/packages/)
from GitLab package registry (as it's too large to sensibly store in Git).

Once downloaded, extract and rename to `ops-data-store`. Then copy to the relevant QGIS profile directory:

* macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles/`

### Running control CLI locally

```shell
$ poetry run ods-ctl [COMMAND] [ARGS]
```

### Contributing

All code changes should be:

- made using a merge request associated with an issue in the project's
  [Issue Tracker ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/issues)
- summarised in the [Change log](./CHANGELOG.md)

### Editorconfig

For consistency is strongly recommended to configure your IDE or other editor to use the [EditorConfig](https://EditorConfig.org) settings defined in [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig).

### Conventions

- except for tests, all Python code should be contained in the [`ops_data_store`](/src/ops_data_store/) package.
- use `Path.resolve()` if displaying or logging file/directory paths in Python
- Python dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) in `pyproject.toml`
- configuration options should be defined in the common [`Config`](/src/ops_data_store/config.py) class and this README
- use logging to record how actions progress, using the `app` logger (e.g. `logger = logging.getLogger('app')`)

### Python dependency vulnerability checks

The [Safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) package is used to check dependencies against known vulnerabilities.

**WARNING!** As with all security tools, Safety is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.
In particular this is using the free vulnerability database, which is updated less frequently than paid options.

Checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration). To check locally:

```shell
$ poetry run safety check --full-report
```

### Python static security analysis

Ruff is configured to run [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit), a static analysis tool for Python.

**WARNING!** As with all security tools, Bandit is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.
In particular this tool can't check for issues that are only be detectable when running code.

### Python linting

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is used to lint Python files. Specific checks and config options are set in
`pyproject.toml`. Linting checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration). To check
locally:

```shell
$ poetry run ruff src/
```

## Testing

### Python tests

All 1st party Python code in the [`ops_data_store`](/src/ops_data_store/) package must be covered by tests, defined in
the [`ops_data_store_tests`](/tests/ops_data_store_tests/) package.

[`pytest`](https://pytest.org) is used as the test framework, configured in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

#### Python test fixtures

Fixtures should be defined in [`conftest.py`](tests/conftest.py), prefixed with `fx_` to indicate they are a fixture,
e.g.:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def fx_test_foo() -> str:
    """Example of a test fixture."""
    return 'foo'
```

#### Python test coverage

Test coverage is checked with [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) with an aim for 100% coverage
(with some exceptions). Exemptions for coverage should be used sparingly and only with good justification. Where tests
are added to ensure coverage, the `cov` [mark](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/mark.html) should be added, e.g:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.cov
def test_foo():
    assert 'foo' == 'foo'
```

#### Test config

An additional [`.test.env`](/.test.env) file is used to override some application config properties, such as the
database. This file requires creating from the [`.example.env`](/.example.env) reference file.

#### Running tests

Tests and coverage checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration). To check
locally:

```shell
poetry run dotenv -f .test.env run -- pytest --strict-markers --random-order --cov --cov-report=html tests
```

### Continuous Integration

All commits will trigger Continuous Integration using GitLab's CI/CD platform, configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## Deployment

### Python package

This project is distributed as a Python package installable from a private package registry provided by the BAS
GitLab instance. It is built by Poetry automatically as part of [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment). If
needed it can also be built manually:

```
$ poetry build
```

### QGIS profile

If the QGIS profile used for testing needs updating, the generic package stored in GitLab can be updated:

```shell
$ curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $BAS_GITLAB_TOKEN" --upload-file qgis/qgis-profile.zip https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/api/v4/projects/1134/packages/generic/qgis-profile/[version]/qgis-profile.zip
```

Where `[version]` is replaced with a calendar based version `YYYY-MM-DD.N`, e.g. the first release on April 12th 2024
would become `2023-04-12.0`. A second release that day would be `2023-04-12.1` etc.

For example:

```shell
$ curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $BAS_GITLAB_TOKEN" --upload-file qgis/qgis-profile.zip https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/api/v4/projects/1134/packages/generic/qgis-profile/2023-04-12.0/qgis-profile.zip
```

### Continuous Deployment

Tagged commits will trigger Continuous Deployment using GitLab's CI/CD platform, configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
