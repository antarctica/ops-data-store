# Operations Data Store

Data store for hosted and managed datasets for BAS Field Operations and Air Unit.

## Overview

### Purpose

This Data Store is a platform provided by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Mapping and Geospatial Information Centre
([MAGIC](https://bas.ac.uk/teams/magic)) for hosting vector geospatial data used by BAS Operational Teams.

It consists of a limited set of managed datasets used and controlled by the BAS Air Unit and Field Operations teams for
planning and delivering field seasons.

**Note:** This project is focused on needs within the British Antarctic Survey. It has been open-sourced in case it's
of use to others with similar or related needs. Some resources, indicated with a ðŸ›¡ symbol, are not accessible publicly.

### Status

This project is an early alpha. The aim is to provide a robust, useful, live service within the next few field seasons.

The aim for this season is to provide a initial minimal implementation which meets core user needs. This will likely
change in form and function based on feedback from end-users and our experience of operating the platform.

### Limitations

As an alpha project, all, or parts, of this service:

- may, but should not, stop working (due to regressions or instability)
- may not work correctly, or as expectedly (including destructively)
- may change at any time (in terms of implementation or functionality)
- may have missing or outdated documentation

**Note:** Support for this project is provided on a best efforts / 'as is' basis.

**WARNING:** Outputs from this project should not be relied upon for operational use without through scrutiny.

### Related projects

This project is limited to the technical and operational aspects of providing a platform for hosting datasets. Other
projects focus on these datasets and other aspects of a providing a wider Geographic Information System (GIS).

* [BAS Air Unit Network Data ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/air-unit-network-dataset)

This project is an evolution of an earlier [Experiment ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/felnne/ops-data-store-exp).

## Usage

### End-user documentation

End-users should consult the documentation developed for the wider
[Field Operations GIS Platform ðŸ›¡](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MbhSFJ1AEZxhIfX9tgr/s/HmSXoUpviCA3XCta5MDr/), as this
specific project is not aimed at end-users directly.

## Development

### Local development environment

Check out project:

```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store.git
$ cd ops-data-store
```

**Note:** If you do not have access to the BAS GitLab instance, clone from GitHub as a read-only copy instead.

#### Python

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is used for managing the Python environment and dependencies.

It's strongly recommended to use the same Python version that will be used when deployed. This is currently *3.9.x*.
It's recommended to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and use a suitable version:

```shell
$ pyenv install 3.9.x
$ pyenv local 3.9.x
$ poetry install
```

### Contribution workflow

All code changes should be:

- made using a merge request associated with an issue in the project's
  [Issue Tracker ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/issues)
- summarised in the [Change log](./CHANGELOG.md)

### Editorconfig

For consistency is strongly recommended to configure your IDE or other editor to use the [EditorConfig](https://EditorConfig.org) settings defined in [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig).

## Release procedure

1. create a release issue and merge request using the *release* issue template
